A Clojure remake of the Mac classic Dungeon of Doom. Written as a fun way to learn Clojure.

I've only got a vague notion about how it will turn out... You'll probably create a character, and he'll explore a dungeon, and collect treasure and fight things. You know, standard operating procedure for your typical adventurer. Or maybe not...

As the rumors tell us, "Death is only a word!"
